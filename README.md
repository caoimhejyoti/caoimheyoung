## Future Developments

As I progress in my coding career, I will bring my projects to this proposal.

In terms of the development of this site, I would like to continue to work with accessibility as a high priority.

While creating this site, I focused on the colour contrast, font sizes and ensuring alt text has been provided for all elements that require them.

Key accessibility things that need I would like to resolve can be see below. I hope to gradually tick them off.

1. Focus, Active and Hover CSS for my menus when on a small device.
2. Look further into aria attributes and work with these as appropriate.
3. Look at adding an expandable container for users to chose whether they want to see every language I have worked with.

I am still learning about accessible design so I welcome all feedback. If you have experienced any access restrictions, please let me know and I will work to reduce these in the future.
