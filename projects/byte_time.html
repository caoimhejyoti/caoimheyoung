        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Created as part of the She Codes Plus program, 2023/2024. This project
          was a final project, created as part of a group. My role within this
          project was the Front End Engineer and Git Manager.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the project, our client cane to us with a problem that needed a
          solution to be created. The problem was that the mentor onboarding and
          scheduling processes at Sche Codes is currently managed across
          multiple platforms requiring a lot of work on the organizers. A key
          aspect was the difficulty in matching mentors to events based on
          availability and skillset. Administrators were also unable to easily
          see the current mentor to attendee ratio per event.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a team we devised our solution: To create an internal platform to
          streamline the onboarding and scheduling process as well as reduce the
          risk of human errors being made. The platform would require mentors to
          access the app and create a profile, providing their level of
          experience and contact details. The mentors would then be able to
          review upcoming events and apply to be a mentor where available.
