          <h2>Who is Caoimhe?</h2>
          <p>
            I am a colourful amalgamation of creative arts and problem solver. I
            may be a fledgling Fullstack developer but that is not stopping me!
          </p>
          <p>
            I am a keen coder and cannot wait to get stuck into the next
            project. Having worked in the Arts and Events industry in the UK, I
            moved to Perth, Australia in 2019 just in time for the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the chaos of settling in my new home and a worldwide
            lockdown, my passion for coding was re-ignited. Having recently
            graduated from the UWA Full Stack Development Bootcamp, I knew there
            was still lots more to learn and am so grateful for Matrix Data
            sponsoring me on the She Codes Australia Plus Course.
          </p>
          <p>
            With my coding skills and my background in the Arts and Events
            industry, I am looking forward to creating some exciting projects in
            the future. I am passionate about creating reality from imagination.
          </p>
          <p>So what world shall we create next?</p>
